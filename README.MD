# Node.js REST API (Vanilla Implementation)

## Overview

This project provides a RESTful API built with core Node.js, demonstrating API development without relying on third-party frameworks like Express.js. It's designed to:

* Offer insight into the underlying mechanics of Node.js API development, illustrating how frameworks abstract complexity.
* Serve as a foundational boilerplate for constructing more sophisticated and robust APIs.


## Features

* **Vanilla Node.js:** Implemented using Node.js's built-in modules (`http`, `url`, `fs`).
* **RESTful Architecture:** Adheres to RESTful principles for endpoint design and HTTP method usage.
* **CRUD Operations:** Supports complete data management:
    * `POST`    : Create new records.
    * `GET`     : Retrieve single or multiple records.
    * `PUT`     : Update existing records.
    * `DELETE`  : Delete records.
* **Database Storage:** Using postrgres database to store data .
